# hng_ass_1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
I made use of the following plugins, also I'm stating their respective functions.
Simple Icon: I used this plugin to get my git icon.
url_launcher: I used this plugin to connect my git icon and the text stating "Open git link" to connect my app
Gap: it function is to create space between the wigets used such as Circle-avatar, Rows, Container and column.

I made use of Andriod studio to write/edit my codes.
